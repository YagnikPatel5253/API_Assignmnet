    "Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "--> Modularity and Reusability: APIs promote modular development by allowing different components of an application to be developed and maintained independently.\n",
    "--> Efficiency and Productivity: APIs provide pre-built functionality and services, allowing developers to leverage existing tools, libraries, and services rather than reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "--> Ecosystem and Innovation: APIs foster the growth of developer ecosystems by encouraging collaboration and the creation of new applications and services that build upon existing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "--> Dependency on External Services: When relying on third-party APIs, application's functionality may be impacted if the API experiences downtime, changes its terms of use, or is discontinued. \n",
    "--> Security and Privacy Concerns: Integrating external APIs introduces potential security and privacy risks. client need to ensure that the APIs they use have robust security measures in place to protect sensitive data.\n",
    "--> Performance and Reliability: The performance and reliability of application may be affected by the performance and reliability of the APIs client rely on. If an API experiences slowdowns or outages, it can impact clients application's responsiveness and user experience."

    "--> A Web API designed to enable communication and interaction between different web-based applications over the internet.\n",

    "Web API:\n",
    "--> Web APIs rely on the HTTP protocol for communication, utilizing methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.\n",

    "--> APIs can be used for integration within a single application or between different systems, using various protocols and interfaces."

    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "1) Complexity: SOAP is generally considered more complex and verbose compared to REST\n",
    "2) Performance: Due to its complexity and additional overhead, SOAP can be slower in terms of performance compared to REST.\n",
